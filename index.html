					<p class="description">This is a game I made for the 7-Day Roguelike challenge back in March of 2015. It was coded entirely from scratch using notepad++ in Javascript, Html, and CSS. I used the game development program GameMaker for some quick prototyping. I'm especially proud of the robust world-generation algorithm, and the wide array of weapons and "potions" (alcohol).</p>

				<div class="descriptionbox">
					<p class="description">I made Fretz for Mini-Ludum Dare 48. The theme was 'Facade', so I made a game where you're supposed to do the opposite of the instructions. The unique physics in the game were actually created when I was coding a simple platform engine in Javascript, and I screwed up a few lines of code with collisions, resulting in the very interesting physical properties that exist in the final game.</p>

				<div class="descriptionbox">
					<p class="description">Smashy Spaceship was made for a GameJolt "Flappy Jam", where you had to make a simple-yet-addictive game, using the aethetetic of some classic game. Naturally, I opted to use the simple graphical style of the classic game 'Asteroids', and I re-made it into an addictive arcade game where you have to dodge asteroids flying in from every direction. It even keeps track of your local highscore!</p>
